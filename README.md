🌦️ Weather Analysis Dashboard 📊
Overview ℹ️
This project aims to analyze weather trends, seasonal variations, and correlations between various weather attributes using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. 
The dataset includes information on city attributes, humidity, pressure, temperature, weather descriptions, wind direction, and wind speed for multiple cities.
